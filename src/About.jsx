            <p>
              I didn‚Äôt start my career pushing pixels, I started by cutting fabric.‚Ä® Before
              becoming a product designer, I was immersed in the world of fashion design,
              sketching patterns, tailoring details, and learning how every stitch could change
              how someone felt. That experience taught me something I‚Äôve carried into every
              digital product I design today, design is about how it feels, not just how it looks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the years, I‚Äôve traded fabric for Figma, but my obsession with crafting
              human-centered experiences hasn‚Äôt changed. I‚Äôve designed for industries as varied
              as agriculture, fintech, eCommerce, edtech, entertainment, blockchain, and AI,
              building mobile apps, web platforms, and even USSD tools that make technology feel
              more human and accessible across East and West Africa and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I‚Äôm not refining user flows or prototyping new ideas, you‚Äôll probably find me
              doodling or sketching isometric worlds, translating abstract thoughts into playful
              visuals. Away from the screen, I‚Äôm a bit of a strategist,
            </p>
            <p>
              I love <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/aribido01">chess</a>, scrabble,
              monopoly, connect four, and a good badminton match. These games keep my mind sharp,
              teaching me patience, timing, and the joy of seeing possibilities unfold, lessons
              that constantly echo in my design work.
            </p>
            <p>
              At home, I share my love for creativity with my daughter, often building imaginary
              cities out of LEGO bricks. And when I‚Äôm not building something with my hands, I‚Äôm
              out on the football pitch, enjoying the same mix of strategy, rhythm, and teamwork
              that drives great design.
            </p>
            <p>
              If there‚Äôs one thing that defines me, it‚Äôs curiosity. I love exploring how things
              work, and how they could work better. Whether I‚Äôm leading a design sprint,
              collaborating with engineers, or testing ideas with real users, I aim to create
              products that don‚Äôt just meet needs, they make people feel seen, understood, and
              empowered.
