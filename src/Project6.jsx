            <ul>
              <li> Many shoppers struggle to find valid, working coupons across different stores and waste time hunting them down.</li>
              <li>Platforms often display expired or invalid codes, undermining trust and frustrating users.</li>
              <li>Aggregator sites typically have cluttered layouts and poor discoverability, making it hard to filter and find relevant deals.</li>
              <li>Users want a fast, reliable, and trustworthy way to access discounts without sifting through noise.</li>

              <p>I spoke with users who frequently search for coupons, asking about frustrations when codes don’t work, how they verify discounts, and what features would make saving easier. Key insights included:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Users want quick confirmation that a code is still valid</li>
                <li>They prefer minimal friction (e.g. not too many clicks)</li>
                <li>Trust is critical — they want assurance the platform is reliable</li>

      <h3>High-Fidelity Design</h3>
      <p>
        Building on the defined structure, I designed clean, high-fidelity UI screens that emphasize clarity, visual hierarchy, and trust. Each interface element was crafted to make browsing and discovering coupons effortless and reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focused on incorporating key trust signals such as “Verified” badges, clear expiry indicators, and easy-to-scan coupon cards. Additionally, I designed intuitive search, filtering, and bookmarking features to help users quickly find and save deals that matter most to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall design reflects a modern, minimal, and trustworthy shopping experience, ensuring users feel confident every time they interact with the platform.
