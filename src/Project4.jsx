          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>Helping one person may not change the entire world, but it can transform their world.</p>
          <p>In East Africa, raising funds for personal, medical, or community needs remains a major challenge, particularly during emergencies or life-changing events. Many people lack access to secure, transparent, and user-friendly crowdfunding platforms that make it simple to request and receive financial support.
          SavePlus was designed to bridge this gap, a digital crowdfunding platform that empowers users to raise funds for meaningful causes, from celebrations and education to unexpected challenges like accidents or illnesses.</p>
          <p>My goal as the Product Designer was to create an accessible, trustworthy, and community-driven platform that helps individuals mobilize financial support quickly and safely when it matters most. The result is a product that not only enables giving but also builds trust, connection, and impact within local communities.</p>

            </div>
            <p>How might we design a secure, user-centred crowdfunding platform that helps people in East Africa easily raise and receive funds for personal or community causes, built for speed, trust, and local relevance?</p>

            </div>
            <p>Design a web-based crowdfunding platform that allows users to create fundraising campaigns, donate to meaningful causes, and receive contributions seamlessly. The platform needed to be intuitive, accessible, and integrated with local payment systems, ensuring a smooth, reliable, and inclusive experience for users across East Africa.</p>

              <p>Impacts</p>
            </div>
            <p>We successfully empowered individuals to raise funds for a wide range of personal and community causes, providing timely financial support when it mattered most.</p>
            <p>For instance, one family raised $1,440 to cover funeral expenses for a loved one, demonstrating the platformâ€™s real-world impact and ability to connect communities through generosity</p>

          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>I conducted user interviews with four individuals who had previously raised funds and two others planning to start fundraising campaigns. These remote phone interviews aimed to uncover the key challenges users face when creating campaigns and receiving donations.</p>
          <p>Insights from these conversations revealed that setting up a cause and managing contributions is often confusing, unstructured, and lacks proper support systems. This research provided valuable input for designing a more intuitive, guided, and user-centered crowdfunding experience that simplifies the entire fundraising journey.</p>

            <h4>Findings</h4>

              <p> <span>The Creator â€“</span> This is the individual who initiates and manages a fundraising campaign. They may be organizing the effort on behalf of someone else and are not always the direct beneficiary of the funds raised. Their role is central to shaping the campaignâ€™s message, building trust, and driving engagement throughout the crowdfunding process.</p>

              <p> <span>The Donor â€“ </span> An individual who contributes financially to support a cause or campaign they care about. Donors play a vital role in the crowdfunding ecosystem, helping individuals and communities achieve their goals through trust, generosity, and meaningful engagement.</p>

        <h2>Understanding the Current Fundraising
        Landscape in East Africa</h2>
        <p>To gain a deeper understanding of how users create fundraising campaigns, donate to causes, and access raised funds, I conducted a competitive analysis of leading crowdfunding platforms such as GoFundMe, Kickstarter, Patreon, and Indiegogo. </p>
        <p>I explored each platformâ€™s core features, user flows, and fund distribution processes, while also reviewing user feedback and reviews to identify common pain points, UX challenges, and best practices. This research provided valuable insights into what makes a crowdfunding experience effective, trustworthy, and user-friendly, shaping the foundation for designing a localized, accessible fundraising platform for East Africa.</p>

          <h2>Sketches</h2>
          <p>To visualize and refine the product experience, I designed and tested multiple wireframe variations to explore different layout structures, navigation patterns, and interaction flows. This iterative process helped identify the most intuitive, user-friendly design, ensuring the final crowdfunding platform delivered a seamless and engaging user experience across all devices.</p>

          <p>I designed the landing page with a focus on cultural relevance, emotional connection, and user trust. Every visual element, from the carefully selected imagery to the integration of <span>Imigongo</span>, a traditional East African design pattern, was chosen to create a familiar and authentic user experience that resonates with local audiences.</p>
          <p>This culturally inspired design approach not only fosters trust but also encourages users to support meaningful causes within their communities.</p>
          <p> To enhance usability, I included a brief onboarding walkthrough that helps first-time users quickly understand how the crowdfunding platform works, making the experience accessible, engaging, and easy to navigate from the very first interaction.</p>

          <p>I designed the cause card to give donors essential information at a glance, making it easier for them to make informed and confident giving decisions. Each card includes a beneficiary image, a short cause description, and a category label, all crafted to provide context, clarity, and emotional connection. </p>
          <p>To strengthen trust and transparency, I added a progress indicator that displays how much has been raised toward the campaign goal, along with a verified badge confirming that the cause has been reviewed and approved by the platform. </p>
          <p>Additionally, donors can easily share campaigns across channels, helping to increase visibility, reach, and community participation. This thoughtful design ensures the crowdfunding experience feels credible, engaging, and user-centered from discovery to donation.</p>

            <p>To wrap up the project, I developed a structured, component-based design system that ensured visual consistency, scalability, and efficiency across the platform. This centralized system streamlined collaboration between design and engineering, enabling faster development and easier maintenance.</p>
            <p>I also facilitated a smooth design-to-development handoff using Figma, providing detailed documentation and specifications to ensure accurate implementation. This process minimized back-and-forth communication, improved team efficiency, and maintained pixel-perfect alignment between design and final build, strengthening the overall UX and product delivery workflow.</p>

            <p>For instance, Jules Karitanyiâ€™s family raised $1,400 to bring their late father home for burial, while Ubuhamya used SavePlus to fund her cancer treatment.</p>
            <p>Stories like these demonstrate the platformâ€™s real-world value, showing how SavePlus empowers communities through digital crowdfunding, connecting people with the financial support they need during lifeâ€™s most critical moments.</p>
