            <h3>Background & Goals</h3>
            <p>SAVE was created from a deep passion to empower unbanked individuals who traditionally save in informal groups using physical cash boxes. The goal was to help them transition to a secure, digital savings platform.</p>

            <p>I collaborated closely with a Project Manager (who also served as an interpreter) and a team of five engineers to bring the project vision to life. Our strong cross-functional teamwork and clear communication created an efficient, aligned, and user-focused design-to-development process, ensuring a smooth transition from concept to execution.</p>

                <p> Led the end-to-end product design process, from user research and wireframing to high-fidelity prototyping and handoff</p>
                <p> Ensured design alignment with core product goals and overall business objectives to maintain a clear user-centred direction</p>
                <p> Conducted and facilitated usability testing sessions to gather real user insights, validate design decisions, and guide data-driven iterations for improved user experience</p>

          <h2>Envisioning Future Experiences / Persona</h2>
          <p>I developed two detailed user personas to keep the design process user-centered and aligned with real customer needs. These personas helped the team empathize with users, understand their goals and pain points, and design experiences that truly resonated with our target audience.</p>

            <h2>Designing Future User Experiences 
            through Storyboarding</h2>
          </div>
          <p>My primary goal was to digitise the traditional group saving system and enhance transparency among members. Through a detailed storyboarding exercise, stakeholders were able to visualise each stage of the saving journey, identify key interaction moments, and uncover user pain points. This process provided valuable UX insights into user behaviours, motivations, and expectations, helping shape a more intuitive and trustworthy digital saving experience.</p>

            <h2>Ideating and Envisioning Future
            User Experiences</h2>
          </div>
          <p>The storyboarding session played a crucial role in defining the problem space and aligning all stakeholders around a shared product vision. It provided a structured framework to map the user journey, identify key touch points, and uncover pain points early in the design process.</p>
           <p> â€¨Through this exercise, I discovered opportunities to challenge existing industry assumptions and reimagine how users engage with group saving systems. This approach led to a more informed, data-driven, and user-centred design strategy, ensuring the final product delivered real value and meaningful user experiences.</p>
