          through User Flows</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Designing an AI-powered news classification platform required a strong focus on optimizing user flows to deliver a seamless and intuitive experience. I explored multiple design iterations, mapping out each key user action, from article classification to dashboard navigation—while continuously refining and testing each step. This user-centered design process ensured that every interaction was simple, efficient, and aligned with the platform’s goal of making intelligent news discovery effortless and engaging.</p>

          <h2>Wire-framing</h2>
        </div>
        <p>To clarify and validate the user experience early in the design process, I began by creating rough sketches and low-fidelity wireframes that visualized my initial ideas for the platforms key interactions.  These early design explorations helped me communicate user flows clearly and align with stakeholders on functionality and priorities before investing time in detailed visuals.By sharing and iterating on these sketches, I gathered valuable stakeholder feedback, refined the information architecture, and ensured that the transition to high-fidelity, production-ready designs was both efficient and user-driven. This collaborative and iterative approach laid a strong foundation for a seamless, intuitive, and scalable AI-powered news platform</p>

          <h2>High-Fidelity Design</h2>
          <p>I quickly transformed low-fidelity sketches into high-fidelity UI designs to craft a polished, user-centered experience for the platform. Using an iterative design process, I developed interactive prototypes that enabled real-world user testing and data-driven validation of design decisions. This approach ensured the final interface was not only visually engaging but also highly functional, intuitive, and optimized for seamless user interaction within the AI-powered news classification platform.</p>

          <h2>Learning & Achievement</h2>
          <p>To finalize the project, I consolidated all UI components into a unified design system, ensuring visual consistency, scalability, and development efficiency across the platform. This Figma-based design system streamlined collaboration, enabling the engineering team to implement, maintain, and iterate on the product with ease.</p>
          <p>For quality assurance, I implemented a side-by-side design validation process, comparing screenshots from the staging environment with the original Figma design files. This method allowed us to quickly identify and resolve visual discrepancies, including spacing inconsistencies, color mismatches, and text errors, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy before launch.
          This structured and detail-oriented approach resulted in a high-quality, production-ready design that was efficient to build, easy to maintain,  and   visually consistent across all user interfaces.</p>
